If today is September 5th, it searches for September 4th notices.
It typically finds 200-300 notices and saves them to a CSV file.

----------
- See DAILY_USE.txt for how to run it every day
- See AUTOMATION_GUIDE.txt to set up automatic daily running
- See TROUBLESHOOTING.txt if you have problems

IMPORTANT NOTES
--------------
- Keep your API keys private and secure
- The scraper is designed to be respectful to the website
- Results are saved with yesterday's date in the filename
- Each run creates a new CSV file - old files are NOT deleted
