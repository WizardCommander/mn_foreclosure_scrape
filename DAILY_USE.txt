DAILY USE GUIDE
===============

This is your simple guide for running the scraper every day.

HOW TO RUN THE SCRAPER
======================

FOR WINDOWS:
-----------
1. Double-click "run_scraper.bat" in your scraper folder
2. Wait for it to check everything (takes 1-2 minutes)
3. When you see "Press Enter to start scraping..." press Enter
4. Wait for it to finish (usually 1 hour+)
5. Check the "csvs" folder for your results

FOR MAC:
-------
1. Double-click "run_scraper.sh" in your scraper folder
2. Wait for it to check everything (takes 1-2 minutes) 
3. When you see "Press Enter to start scraping..." press Enter
4. Wait for it to finish (usually 1 hour+)
5. Check the "csvs" folder for your results

WHAT TO EXPECT
=============

Typical Daily Results:
- 200-300 notices found and processed
- Results saved to CSV file named with yesterday's date
- Example: mn_notices_2025-09-04.csv (contains data from September 4th)

Runtime:
- 1 hour+ for a full run
- Longer on busy days (more notices to process)
- Shorter on weekends/holidays (fewer notices)

What You'll See:
- Progress messages showing which notice is being processed
- "Captcha solved" messages (this is normal)
- VPN connection status
- Final summary with number of records saved

UNDERSTANDING THE OUTPUT
=======================

CSV File Columns:
- first_name: Person's first name
- last_name: Person's last name  
- street: Street address
- city: City
- state: State (always MN)
- zip: ZIP code
- date_filed: When the notice was filed
- plaintiff: Who filed the notice (bank, creditor, etc.)
- link: Link to the original notice
- notice_id: Internal ID number

Good Daily Run:
- File created in csvs folder
- 200-300 records (typical)
- Recent date in filename
- No major error messages

IMPORTANT REMINDERS
==================

ALWAYS USE VPN:
- Make sure Mullvad VPN is connected before running
- Check VPN status in the startup messages
- WITHOUT VPN: You will get IP banned for 2+ days
- The scraper tells you if VPN is working

Run Once Per Day:
- The scraper automatically gets YESTERDAY'S notices
- Running multiple times per day gets the same data
- Daily automation is recommended (see AUTOMATION_GUIDE.txt)

Check Your Balances:
- 2captcha account: Should decrease slowly ($2-5/month)
- OpenAI account: Should decrease slowly ($3-10/month)
- Mullvad VPN: $5/month subscription

WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
===================

No CSV File Created:
- Check for error messages in the scraper output
- Verify VPN is connected
- Check if you're IP banned (see TROUBLESHOOTING.txt)

Empty or Small CSV File:
- Normal on weekends/holidays (courts closed)
- Check the date - some days have fewer notices
- Verify API keys are working

Scraper Runs But Stops Early:
- Usually an IP ban or connection issue
- Check VPN status
- Wait and try again later

Many Captcha Failures:
- Check 2captcha account balance
- 2captcha service might be slow (normal occasionally)

MONTHLY MAINTENANCE
==================

Check Every Month:
1. 2captcha account balance - add funds if low
2. OpenAI account balance - add credits if low  
3. Mullvad VPN subscription - auto-renews usually
4. Clear old CSV files if you have many (optional)

Signs Everything is Working:
- New CSV file every day with yesterday's date
- 200-300 records per file (typical)
- No error messages
- VPN connects successfully

DAILY WORKFLOW EXAMPLE
======================

Morning Routine (if running manually):
1. Check that Mullvad VPN is running
2. Double-click run_scraper.bat (or .sh)
3. Press Enter when prompted
4. Walk away or let it scrape in the background (for about 1 hour)
5. Check csvs folder for new file
6. Import CSV into your lead management system

Automated (recommended):
1. Set up automation (see AUTOMATION_GUIDE.txt)
2. Check csvs folder each morning for new file
3. File will be there automatically from overnight run (if computer was powered on)

The scraper is designed to be reliable and hands-off once properly set up. Most problems are solved by ensuring VPN is connected making sure API accounts have sufficient funds, and retrying a scrape if something goes wrong.
